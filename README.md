Merge Data Surveys
## Features

Fetching Surveys: When a user opens the app, it connects to the online platform and retrieves the surveys that the client has created.
Offline Storage: The app then stores these surveys locally on the user's device, allowing them to be accessed even without an internet connection.
Offline Completion: Users can fill out the surveys directly on their smartphone, even if they're offline. Their answers are saved locally.
Synchronization: When the user has an internet connection again, the app can synchronize the completed surveys and their responses back to the online platform.
